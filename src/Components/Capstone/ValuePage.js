                <Typography variant="body1">
                  The main features of the conception of basic values implicit in the writings of many theorists and researchers as follows:
                </Typography>
                <ul>
                  <li> Values are beliefs. But they are beliefs tied inextricably to emotion, not objective, cold ideas. </li>
                  <li> Values are a motivational construct. They refer to the desirable goals people strive to attain. </li>
                  <li> Values transcend specific actions and situations. They are abstract goals. 
                    The abstract nature of values distinguishes them from concepts like norms and attitudes, 
                    which usually refer to specific actions, objects, or situations.</li>
                  <li> Values guide the selection or evaluation of actions, policies, people, and events. 
                    That is, values serve as standards or criteria. </li>
                  <li> Values are ordered by importance relative to one another. 
                    Peopleâ€™s values form an ordered system of value priorities that characterize them as individuals. 
                    This hierarchical feature of values also distinguishes them from norms and attitudes.</li>
